## Crypto trading strategies and execution.

You can now downlaod gdax data using the [gdax-python](https://github.com/danpaquin/gdax-python) api. Install it from HEAD in your environment

    ```
    python setup.py install
    ```
    
Once blockhead is checked out and [Anaconda 3.6](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) is installed, do an install of the requirements

    ```
    conda create -n blockhead  --file requirements.txt
    ```
